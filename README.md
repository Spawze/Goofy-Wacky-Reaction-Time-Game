## Summary 
___________________________________
This application provides users the ability to create their own personal accounts using a username and password - Having your own account means you're able to save your personal scores without having anyone mess them up! Once the user creates an account and logs in, they are able to play a game of reaction time. The app generates a red block and then randomly changes color to green, as soon as it changes color, you click the block and the app will track how fast you clicked it. The application will save user information a database and use that to display it in the leaderboards.
